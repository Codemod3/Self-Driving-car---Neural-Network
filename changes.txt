Neural Network
Initialization
Switched to Xavier/Glorot initialization instead of full random [-1,1] → prevents early saturation, more stable learning.
Biases start at 0 instead of random → lets them shift naturally during evolution.
FeedForward
Changed threshold check from sum > bias to sum + bias > 0 → makes biases act as proper thresholds.
Mutation
Replaced linear interpolation mutation with Gaussian noise mutation (scaled by fan-in).
Added clamp to keep weights/biases in [-1,1] range.
Mutations are gentler and more meaningful → car learns instead of random resets.

Utils
Added two helper functions:
randn() → generates Gaussian noise (Box–Muller).
clamp(x, lo, hi) → keeps values bounded.

Script.js
Best Car Handling
Removed shadowing bug (const bestCar inside animate).
Now updates a single global bestCar each frame → ensures correct saving & visualization.
Save function now saves the actual best car brain, not always cars[0].
Mutation Strength
Reduced mutation rate (0.1 → 0.15 Gaussian) → less destructive, steadier improvement.
Visualization
Lowered ghost-car opacity (0.2 → 0.15) → clearer view of the best car.
